# TP-GAN
TP-GAN Pytorch implementation.
This was done as part of a class on computer vision. 
The obtained results are much below the paper's results, so this repo should not be used as a valid implementation.

Original paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04086.pdf

Original codebase : https://github.com/HRLTY/TP-GAN

Strongly inspired by this implementation : https://github.com/iwtw/pytorch-TP-GAN

The trained model is available with this link :
